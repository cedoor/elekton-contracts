Elekton is an e-voting system that uses non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technologies to allow users to vote anonymously in a verifiable and transparent manner. The goal of zero-knowledge proofs is for a *verifier* to be able to convince herself that a *prover* possesses knowledge of a secret parameter. In the Elekton system the verifier is a Solidity smart contract, whereas the prover is the voter, who must create a valid off-chain proof in order to send a transaction and to cast a new vote on an on-chain ballot anonymously. 

In recent years [zk-SNARK](https://doi.org/10.1145/2090236.2090263) has aroused a lot of interest. ZCash uses it to provide a privacy-focused cryptocurrency with a strong mechanism for creating anonymous transactions and many development tools make it easy to use for the integration with other types of blockchains as well. [Iden3](https://www.iden3.io/) provides for example several tools, which are just used in the Elekton system.

[Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) is used to create the voting circuit, whereas [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) is used to generate the proofs and export the verifier as a Solidity smart contract. The circuit requires the use of some ZK-friendly algorithms: [Merkle trees](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-48184-2_32), [EdDSA](https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC8032) and [Poseidon](https://www.poseidon-hash.info/). Circom actually requires a special kind of Merkle tree, the sparse Merkle tree (SMT), which can be used to create not only membership proofs, but also non-membership proofs. Elekton uses the [SMT](https://github.com/cedoor/sparse-merkle-tree) TypeScript implementation and the [Circomlib](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib) JavaScript library, which provides several zk-friendly algorithm implementations.

## Install

With the following installed packages:

-   git
-   node
-   yarn

Clone the repo and install the dependencies from npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cedoor/elekton-contracts.git
cd elekton-contracts
yarn
```

## Usage

Create the snark artifacts (takes a few minutes) and test with:

```
yarn snark
yarn test
```

If you want to interact with the contracts from the outside you can create a [hardhat node](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/)
on `http://localhost:8545`, compile and deploy contracts with:

```
yarn start
yarn compile
yarn deploy
```
