Elekton is a simple e-voting system that uses non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technologies to allow users to vote anonymously in a verifiable and transparent way. The goal of zero-knowledge proofs is for a *verifier* to be able to convince herself that a *prover* possesses knowledge of a secret parameter. In the Elekton system the verifier is a Solidity smart contract, whereas the prover is the voter, who must create a valid off-chain proof in order to send a transaction and vote on an on-chain ballot anonymously. 

In recent years [zk-SNARK](https://doi.org/10.1145/2090236.2090263) has aroused a lot of interest. ZCash uses it to provide a privacy-focused cryptocurrency with a strong mechanism for creating anonymous transactions and many development tools make it easy to use for the integration with other types of blockchains as well. [Iden3](https://www.iden3.io/) provides for example several tools to use zk-SNARK with Ethereum, and they are just used in the Elekton system. [Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) is used to create the voting [circuit](https://github.com/cedoor/elekton-contracts/blob/main/circuit/scheme.png), whereas [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) is used to generate the proofs and export the verifier as a Solidity smart contract. The circuit requires the use of some ZK-friendly algorithms: [Merkle trees](https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-48184-2_32), [EdDSA](https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC8032) and [Poseidon](https://www.poseidon-hash.info/). Circom actually requires a special kind of Merkle tree, the sparse Merkle tree (SMT), which can be used to create not only membership proofs, but also non-membership proofs. Elekton uses the [SMT](https://github.com/cedoor/sparse-merkle-tree) TypeScript implementation and the [Circomlib](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib) JavaScript library, which provides several zk-friendly algorithm implementations.

In order to create anonymous transactions it is necessary to use an universal shared Ethereum account to sign them, and in order to have more scalability it is necessary to use a PoA consensus mechanism. For this reason the best solution is to use a permissioned blockchain with a free-gas network. Elekton uses [Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/), an Ethereum client written in Java that implements Proof of Work (Ethash) and Proof of Authority (IBFT 2.0 and Clique) consensus mechanisms.

Elekton is a PoC, and it simply wants to show how blockchain and zk-proof technologies can be used together to create a good anonymous e-voting system. In addition to this repository there is a JavaScript library ([elekton.js](https://github.com/cedoor/elekton.js)) with the functions to interact with the Elekton contract and a simple [DApp](https://github.com/cedoor/elekton-dapp) which in turn uses elekton.js and allows you to create users, ballots and to vote anonymously.

## Install

Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cedoor/elekton-contracts.git
cd elekton-contracts
yarn # or `npm i`
```

Install the binary distribution of [Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options/Install-Binaries/), used to start a development zero-gas network. The `besu` command line must be executable from the terminal.

## Usage

Create the snark artifacts (it takes a few minutes) and start the Besu development network:

```bash
yarn snark
yarn start
```

Test the contract functions and deploy a contract instance:

```bash
yarn test
yarn deploy # It print the contract address.
```

Now you can interact with the contract using Remix or Web3.js on `http://localhost:8545` or `ws://localhost:8546`.
